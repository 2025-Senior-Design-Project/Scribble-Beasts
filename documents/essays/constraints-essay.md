## Project Constraints Essay

Our project faces several important constraints across multiple areas.

In terms of diversity and cultural considerations, we must design for accessibility so all users can participate. This includes helping players with poor eyesight through larger font options, supporting those with shaking hands or coordination difficulties, and making sure the game works for people who may not own expensive devices.

From an economic perspective, our solution's costs increase as we gain more users. As more players join at the same time, we need to pay for better hosting and more powerful servers. Right now we have limited funds, which means we can only support a certain number of players before we need more money for technology upgrades.

Security is a key concern that affects our technical decisions. We use careful controls on all server communications to stop harmful code or unwanted access to our systems. Our design protects user privacy by only storing the drawings people make and the names they choose to display, with no other personal information collected.

The social impact of our project focuses on helping people connect and have fun together. The game works well for friends spending time together, families connecting from different locations, and companies running team activities. By creating an enjoyable shared experience, we help strengthen relationships and build community among players.
