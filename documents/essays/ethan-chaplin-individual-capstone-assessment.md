# Ethan Chaplin's Individual Capstone Assessment

## Introduction

Scribble Beasts is a multi-player collaborative drawing game. It is free-to-play for anyone with internet access. From a development perspective, it is a challenging union of asynchronous network protocols and synchronous client-side logic. Its design requires careful planning and execution to create a cohesive playing experience. All events must happen in order, or else there might be bugs or other unfavorable outcomes. It is a great display of many different disciplines which are covered within a degree in Computer Science, and I am excited to help develop it.

## Collective College Experiences

### College Curriculum

There are many different courses that I can draw from for guidance with this project. I am currently taking Computer Networks and Networked Computing (CS 4065), which will assist with the socket programming and protocols required to send data back and forth from clients to the server. Building proper packets and control timing is of the utmost importance to ensure the game runs smoothly. I am also enrolled in User Interface I (CS 5167), which will help with the implementation of the interface in which players will interact with the game. Creating an intutive and stylized UI will help immerse players in the game, and keep them engaged.

### Co-Op Experiences

I can also draw on my co-op experiences for the practical skills to build this software. At Genetesis, my first rotation was focused on creating user interfaces from static designs. Technology like React can be vital in designing fluid and modern interfaces. At Genetesis, I also grew experienced with version control systems like GitHub, and work assignment software like Jira. Both tools are very useful for keeping track of code versions, and overall progress of the project. I can create cards to track the completion of certain elements and will be able to fully define the scope of the software within these cards.

## Motivation

I have always been interested in game development, especially in an online space, so I believe this is a good first step. It is not too network intensive, but it does require some advanced experience. I also love playing games similar to Scribble Beasts with friends, so this could become one that I add to a list of games I have ready to suggest. I have also always wanted to write music for a medium like this, so this project is a great experience for me not just in a software context. This project combines several aspects of hobbies and career aspirations of mine, so it will be fun to work on. Finally, working in a group setting is a great way to participate in a collaborative environment before I start a career.

## Preliminary Project Approach

Given the game is partially fleshed out in a physical version, we will start by emulating it digitally. From the rounds to the cards, we have our work cut out at the start. From there, we will finish and flourish the elements which can be helped by the digital format, like the room system and the other creative aspects, like the music. After finishing the MVP (minimum viable product), we will open the game to playtesting and recieve feedback from other players. After a couple rounds, if there are no glaring issues raised by playtesters, we will consider the first version of our game complete and ready to open to the public. From there, we will continue making improvements based off of the greater public's feedback.
