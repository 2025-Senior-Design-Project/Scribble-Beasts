# Ana Cedillo's Individual Capstone Assessment

## Project Introduction 
Our senior design project is called Scribble Beasts, a web game where players collaboratively create beasts out of scribbles to save the world. The game loop begins when a host creates a room and other players join. Once the game starts, each player takes turns scribbling, adding lines, colors, and names across several rounds. After each round, drawings are passed to different players so that everyone contributes to each beast. Then, a random apocalypse card is drawn, and players argue why their beast would be able to solve that problem. Players vote on the winner, and the game ends by announcing the results. To handle the many asynchronous events that occur in real time, the project will use websockets for communication. The frontend is being developed with Svelte, Flowbite, the Canvas API, and Typescript, while the backend uses Node.js and ws.

## College Experiences
### College curriculum
My college courses have given me important skills that will guide me through this project. In my User Interface class (CS 5167), I worked extensively with Svelte, which I will now apply while designing the game’s interface. This course helped me understand how to create interactive and user-friendly designs, which is key for a drawing-based game. In my Computer Networks and Networked Computing class (CS 4065), I learned about network protocols and websockets, which are central to implementing multiplayer rooms and real-time events. These classes also taught me how to approach problems step by step and collaborate effectively with others. I plan to use both the technical knowledge and teamwork experience I gained in these courses. Altogether, my curriculum has provided me with the foundation to take on this project successfully.

### Co-op experiences
My co-op experience has also prepared me to work on this project. At Close the Loop, I worked as a Web App Developer and learned how to use Docker and connect systems with APIs. I also strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which will all be helpful in building out the game’s frontend. Beyond the technical side, I developed non-technical skills such as communication, problem-solving, and workflow improvement. For example, I learned how to communicate effectively with my team, solve unexpected issues, and improve processes to keep projects running smoothly. These lessons will help me contribute to the project in a well-rounded way. I will apply both the technical and professional skills I gained from Close the Loop to ensure our team stays organized and productive.

## Project's Motivation
I am excited to work on Scribble Beasts because the idea feels unique, and it gives me the chance to learn something I have wanted to explore for a long time (websockets for synchronous multiplayer rooms). I previously worked on a project that used multiplayer rooms, but I never had the opportunity to actually learn how to build them. This project finally gives me that chance. I am also motivated because it allows me to keep building on tools I already know, like Svelte and Docker, while also challenging myself to learn new ones. That combination makes the project both exciting and rewarding. I believe this will be one of the most meaningful projects I have worked on during college.

## Preliminary Project Approach
Our approach will be to translate the existing physical card version of the game into a fully functioning web version. The first step will be ensuring that websocket communication works reliably for room creation, drawing rounds, and voting. Once that is in place, we will focus on the user interface and overall player experience. The expected result is a web game that runs smoothly and gives players a fun, collaborative experience. To evaluate my contributions, I will test whether the game functions properly, whether it meets our design goals, and whether it provides a smooth user experience. I will know I have done a good job when the game works as intended and players can enjoy it from beginning to end.
