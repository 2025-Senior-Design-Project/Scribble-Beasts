# Milestones

**1. Environment Setup**
- Set up a Docker container with Nginx, a Svelte client, and a Node.js server to create a scalable foundation for the game’s website, ensuring smooth development and testing.

**2. Real-Time Communication**
- Build a WebSocket ping-pong system to enable fast, reliable communication between the client and server, supporting real-time multiplayer interactions.

**3. Game Object Design**
- Define Player, Room, Game, and Round objects to establish the game’s core structure, guiding how players, rooms, and rounds function together.

**4. Room and Lobby Creation**
- Develop systems for players to create or join rooms and a lobby where they wait, forming the basic framework for multiplayer group setup.

**5. Game Start System**
- Create a mechanism to start the game from the lobby, syncing all players to begin gameplay together, ready for interactive rounds.

**6. Basic Round Framework**
- Implement a placeholder round with a timed button to test the round structure, laying the groundwork for more complex gameplay mechanics.

**7. Drawing and Naming Rounds**
- Build rounds for drawing (scribbles, lines, colors) using HTML Canvas and typing text for naming creations, enabling collaborative and creative gameplay with image sharing.

**8. Scenario and Presentation Rounds**
- Add rounds for random end-of-the-world scenarios and player presentations, showing creations with text, art, and early finish options for engaging storytelling.

**9. Voting and Winner Rounds**
- Create rounds for voting on creations via a grid with tap-to-vote and announcing the winner with a replay button, adding competition and closure.

**10. Iterative Playtesting**
- Run three playtests—after drawing, after naming/scenario, and with all rounds done—to gather feedback, fix bugs, and polish the game for release.
