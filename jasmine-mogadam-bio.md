## Project Sought
I have a specific idea in mind for a jackbox-esc webgame. In the past I made a room/login system for it in pure javascript, but now I want to make the full thing in svelte https://github.com/Jasmine-Mogadam/scribble-beasts-hackathon .
There are several issues with the code I wrote, so this would be an entire rewrite, including some well-needed data structure changes. Skills this would require are:
- Svelte (frontend)
- Node (backend)
- Websockets
- Docker
- Dev Containers
